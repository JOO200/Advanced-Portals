# WorldEdit Integration

You can configure AdvancedPortals to use WorldEdit instead of the Selection Tool from AdvancedPortals.

To enable the integration (add and) set the config option `WorldEditIntegration` to "true".

**This will disable the commands `/portal wand` (or `/portal selector`) and will use cuboid selections from WorldEdit instead.**

## Additional Commands

### Select Portal as WorldEdit selection

You can use `/portal we-selection` with a portal name to select the portal as cuboid worldedit selection.
This command becomes available when WorldEdit is installed.
